# Beyond-the-Gender-Binary
Replication code and data for the paper [Campbell, Badgett, and Brennan (2021)](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3784771) *Beyond the Gender Binary: Transgender Labor Force Status in the United States 2014-2017*.

The "Master.do" do-file reports each step of the analysis. The anlysis was carried out on Stata 16. 

All source data used in the analysis is publically available from the CDC, [here](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/annual_data.htm). Hence, only the constructed dataset used for our analysis is shared here. Unless the source code is downloaded, replication excerices should begin with Section 4 of the "Master.do" do-file.
