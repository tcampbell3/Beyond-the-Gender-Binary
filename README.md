# Beyond-the-Gender-Binary
Replication code and data for the paper [Campbell et al. (2023)](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3784771) *Beyond the Gender Binary: Transgender Labor Force Status in the United States 2014-2017*.

The "Master.do" do-file reports each step of the analysis. The analysis was carried out on Stata 17. 

All source data used in the analysis is publically available from the CDC, [here](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/annual_data.htm), and the NBER, [here](https://data.nber.org/data/cps_basic.html). Hence, only the constructed dataset used for our analysis is shared here. Unless the source code is downloaded, replication exercises should begin with Section 4 of the "Master.do" do-file.
